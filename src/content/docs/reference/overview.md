description: An overview of the RPG Resource Repository
---

RPG resources for tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons. At the time of writing this, you'll find generic (ex. random tables) and 5E (ex. backgrounds, feats, etc) resources. For the latter, I try to target 2024 rules, where possible.

Use this material for inspiration or wholesale in accordance with the [licensing](reference/licensing) granted for it. If you decide to use it for any commercial products, please consider reaching out to let me know. I always enjoy seeing how the material is used and I'd be happy to support your project. ❤️

## Markdown Format

Text in the RPG Resource Repository is backed by markdown source files. If you want to download the markdown version of any page, head to the [Github repository](https://github.com/phd20/rpg-resource-repository) (link also in the site navigation via the Github icon). 

## Contributing

I would love to scale this to more creators than just myself that are willing to add RPG material to the Creative Commons. I'm currently working on prototyping out what multiple licenses/attributions would look like with material already under CC. If you're interested in seeing your creations here, please <a href="mailto:kirk@phd20.com?subject=RPG Resource Repository">email me</a>.
