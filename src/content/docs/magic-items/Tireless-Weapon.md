# Tireless Weapon

*Legendary (10,000 gp)* *Requires Attunement*

Each time you would suffer one Exhaustion level, you gain no levels of exhaustion. Instead, the weapon stores two Exhaustion levels. This weapon can store up to 6 Exhaustion levels and suffers no penalties as a result.

When your attunement to the weapon ends, you instantly gain the number of Exhaustion levels stored by the weapon and suffer their normal effects. After that, the weapon no longer has any Exhaustion levels stored.
