Bring your setting to life with your own holidays and festivals using these tables.

- **Event**. Use the [event table](#event) to either time your festival or inspire where it came from.
- **Focus**. Use the [focus table](#focus) to determine what the festival focuses on.
- **Flavor**. Use the [flavor table](#flavor) to inspire additional ideas and flavor for your festival.

A few examples:

- *Hour of the Ancestors*: A festival during the solar eclipse in which people honor their ancestors by preparing for their brief return. It is said that the spirits who do return can only step foot outside during the height of the eclipse. (Solar eclipse, ancestors, outdoors)
- *Revival*: At the beginning of the year, a festival is held to honor children. They’re showered with gifts and fun events, with everyone wears bright clothing. (Beginning, youth, bright colors)
- *Wisdom of Spring*: At the spring equinox, a festival is held to honor the elders—without the work of our elders, we could not enjoy the fruits of spring. Elders tell stories to the children while adults focus on building monuments to those that have passed on in the last year. (Spring equinox, elders, storytelling, building - rolling twice provides even more inspiration)
